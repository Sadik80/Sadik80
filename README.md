💫 About Me:

👋 Hi, I’m Sadiq, a passionate B.Tech Computer Engineering Student who loves solving problems with code.
🌱 Currently exploring Web Development (React, Firebase, Node.js) and Machine Learning.
⚡ I’ve built apps during hackathons, ranging from women’s health platforms to student–school bus connectors, and I enjoy innovating under constraints.
🔥 I’m also exploring systems programming (building compilers in C/C++) for deeper understanding of how computers work.
🌍 I believe in open-source and love collaborating on impactful projects.

 
🏆 Hackathon Journey:

⚡ 36-hour Hackathon (Open Source theme): Built an innovative student app.

🌱 Women’s Health Hackathon (Aarambika): Created a habit-growth system linked with tree planting.

🎯 Love building real-world impactful solutions under tight deadlines.
